to run the unit tests for this feature:

Compared to the iteration 1 design document, we largely followed the functions outlined in the handling slash command and events feature. We fleshed out the handle_slash_command function more, by having the function branch off into intermediate handling functions, for slash commands that require parameters. The idea is handle_slash_command is the first function called whenever a slash command is invoked. From there is directly handles calling the slash command implementation functions written in the other features, for slash commands that do not have parameters. We also thought that handle_slash_command should also handle defective payload information, since we are relying on Slack to provide us non-malformed data in their POST requests.
