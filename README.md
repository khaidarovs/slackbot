# Acceptance tests:
# You can enter a time in the form of "XsXmXhXd" where X are different integers.

# meetup converts string explaination of a time to seconds
# wait_message adds a log to the database with the meeting timestamp, location, message
# in_five checks whether an event occurs within the next five minutes. 
# If so, a message will be sent after a delay.

# Made by Maya Hall and Jason Huang
# We plan to change the storage method to Firebase in the near future
# Additionally, we intend to add alternate formats/features for meet times.
